This is the repository for the computer architecture group assignments and project.

 ### P3_Cache
 Contains the code for a cache implementation.

 ### P4_Pipeline
 Contains the code for a MIPS 32 bit pipelined processor

 ### P5 Optmimized Processor
 Contains the code for an optimized processor.
 We have opted to implement a cached memory access scheme. Instead of a data memory and instruction memory, we will have a split cache.

 In order to test this, we will run a series of instructions, and benchmark programs before and after the optimizations.
